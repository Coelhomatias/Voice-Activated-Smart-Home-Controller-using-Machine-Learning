# Voice-Activated Smart Home Controller Using Machine Learning

## Description

This repository contains the dataset used in the Voice-Activated Smart Home Controller Using Machine Learning project. The dataset contains temperature and brightness measurements of the inside and outside of a room equipped with smart blinds, labeled with the position of the blinds for that given moment. The measurements were taken by the minute, over a period of approximately three months, following the real behavior of person. The final dataset contains over 120 thousand examples, 14 features and 1 label.
